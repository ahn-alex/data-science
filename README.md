# Data Science (Test Environment Practice)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed to simulate technical tests or interviews where **internet access, time, and library usage are restricted**. It serves as a personal playground to practice data handling, modeling, and logic-based coding under real-world exam conditions.

⚙️ **Focus**: Quick, efficient problem-solving using standard libraries only — no StackOverflow, no web search, no luxury imports.

## 🔍 Key Practice Areas

- **Data Cleaning & Manipulation**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Basic ML Modeling**
- **Algorithmic Thinking**
- **Efficiency under Constraints**

## 🧪 Assumptions for Practice

- ⛔ No internet access (e.g., offline JupyterHub or test platform)
- ⛔ Limited time (simulated under ~30–60 minutes per problem)
- ⛔ Only core libraries allowed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`)
